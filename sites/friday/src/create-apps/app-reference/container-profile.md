By default, Upsun allocates a container profile to each app and service depending on the range of resources itâ€™s
expected to need.

Each container profile gives you access to a specific list of CPU and RAM combinations.
Using the Upsun CLI or Console, you can then pick a CPU and RAM combination for each of your apps and services.

- [Container profile types and resources](/manage-resources/adjust-resources#advanced-container-profiles)
- [Default container profiles](/manage-resources/adjust-resources#default-container-profiles) for runtime and service
  containers
- [Customize resources using the `container_profile` key](/manage-resources/adjust-resources#adjust-a-container-profile)
