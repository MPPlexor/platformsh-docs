## Define disk space
Disk for application containers are not committed to YAML files, but instead managed over the API using either the
Console or the `{{% vendor/cli %}} resources:set` command.

For more information, see how to [manage resources](/manage-resources.md).

## Downsize a disk

{{% disk-downsize type="app" %}}
