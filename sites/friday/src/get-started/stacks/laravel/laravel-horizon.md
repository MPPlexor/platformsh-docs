    Setting up Laravel Horizon

[Laravel Horizon](https://laravel.com/docs/master/horizon#main-content) provides a beautiful dashboard and code-driven configuration for your Laravel powered Redis queues. Horizon allows you to easily monitor key metrics of your queue system such as job throughput, runtime, and job failures.

## Adding Laravel Horizon to your project

First make sure you followed the step on [how to configure Redis and queues](./setup-redis.html#using-redis-for-laravel-queues).

```bash
composer require laravel/horizon

php artisan horizon:install
```

We also need to add the `install` command in our `build` hook so it is run on every deploy. Head to `{{< vendor/configfile "app" >}}` and update it with the following:

```yaml
build: |
        set -eux
        composer --no-ansi --no-interaction install --no-progress --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
+       php artisan horizon:install
```

## Creating a worker to run Horizon

We are now going to add a separate worker to run Horizon on our project. Open `{{< vendor/configfile "app" >}}` and add the following:

```yaml
applications:
  [...]
    {{< variable "PROJECT_NAME" >}}:
    [...]
    workers:
      horizon:
        commands:
          start: |
            php artisan horizon
```

You can now enable it by pushing the change to `{{< vendor/name >}}`:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Enable Laravel Horizon"
{{< vendor/cli >}} push
```

This way, a new container will be started automatically and will spawn the Horizon process after the next deploy.

If you have restricted access to horizon in your `HorizonServiceProvider.php`, login to your application through the web. Once done, head to `/horizon` and you should be able to access your horizon dashboard.

Horizon will handle jobs that are populated by the queue. If you need to customize how Horizon works (queues, processes, â€¦), please refer to the official [Laravel Horizon documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/master/horizon#main-content).


{{< note title="Warning">}}

Web and worker containers don't share mounts targets.
So you can't share files between those containers using the filesystem.
To share data between containers, use [services](/add-services/_index.md).

{{< /note >}}


As any other container, the resources of the Horizon container can be customized. Head to the Configure resources panel of the Upsun console and change the resources as needed:
